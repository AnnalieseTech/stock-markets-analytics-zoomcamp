## Module 4 Homework


In this homework,  you're required to understand how system works as a whole, be able to adjust the code, and correctly interpret it. 
It will be just a few lines of code, and you have hints in the code in the form of comments "TODO: HQ4 Q.." 


Please use the [Colab Module 3](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/stock-markets-analytics-zoomcamp/blob/main/03-modeling/Module_3_Colab_Time_Series_Modeling.ipynb) for all tasks to ensure you have the same dataframe used for the Modeling part, as covered during the lecture.
